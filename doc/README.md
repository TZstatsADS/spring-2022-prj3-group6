### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

In this folder is the main training and testing Jupyter Notebook, as well as both of our models in raw h5 format. 

The subfolder `exploration files` represents trial work and explorations that eventually had pieces go into the final model.
